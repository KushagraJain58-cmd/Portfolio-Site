			<p>Corona has made me realise that nothing is above life. For whole life, we stock our brain from all sorts of tension for career, job, country's economy, money, market because of which we somehow forget to live. As people say, "seize the day" but they never do. When it comes to human life, everything else just fades away.
			<br><br>Market all over the worldwide is crashing, share market has never seen such a low hit, GDP of the country is at its minimum, there is recession all over, events are being cancelled incurring losses of millions. Everything is shutting down, schools, colleges, markets, gyms, malls, theatres, offices. I don't know if it has ever happened, everyone around the globe is staying at their home. All because to save life. It has made me realise that things after which we are running since we have been into our senses are all temporary.
			<br>People say that they can't live without something or the other, xyz is more important than their life, it's 100% lie. Money can be earned later, country's GDP can be improved but once the life is gone, it will never come back.

			<br><br>Indian government has been tabooed as “late latif”, the one who is always late whether in reaching somewhere or taking actions. But in corona virus pandemic, spontaneous necessary decisions and active participation by government smashed all the taboos, not just central government but state governments as well. The lock down of all the places, strict police patrolling, checking travel history of every citizen, active hospital staff, creating awareness even in the remotest areas are all weapons to fight against this pandemic. People can go out their house just to buy basic necessities like grocery, milk and so on and that too not for long. Police is keeping eye on every general store, patrolling every area and straight away arresting or charging fines for breaking rules. This strictness and awareness are helping India fighting its battle along with other countries. 

			<br><br>I have been staying at my home too. Usually, my days are so hectic that it blocks me to expand my horizons, to see above these materialistic attractions. But corona has given me new respect for life. If I die tomorrow, I don't want an offer letter in my hand which will be of no use then, I would want to have those experiences which will become my flashback movie at my death bed. Before dying, I want my novel out there with my name on the cover written below the title.
			<br><br>We procrastinate what we really want to do in order to follow our urgent priorities. We think once we settle down, earn well then, we will follow our passion. But it's an endless vicious circle. We will never reach an end until it's deathbed. The assignments, work projects, family duties will never finish and then we say, "I don't get time". We can have time for everything, only the task is how. 
			<br>I want to live happily today so that if I die tomorrow, I don't repent for my yesterday.

			<br><br>Every article, every news and even every conversation is about corona virus these days. People are living in fear creating panic all over. At the same time, they are bored staying at their houses. But just think, we all have to die one day, yes there is a possibility that it could be tomorrow, so would you like to spend your last day like this, in tension, in fear?
			<br><br>Or being at home, you could discover all those magical hidden insights of yours which were lost somewhere outside in the world. Learn or do those things for which you never got time, like cooking, morning workout, watering plants, writing diary or finishing a novel.
			<br>Try to make your own world for some days, and realise the difference on your own.
