			<p>Dear Winter,<br>
You come and go every year. For me, you are like a festival. A festival which brings peace and comfort. A festival which is most awaited throughout the year. People ask me, “Why do you love winter so much?”
I answer, “Because I love to wear boots, mufflers, hoodies, jackets, overall, all winter clothes.” Well, that’s only half truth. Even I don’t know one exact reason why I love you so much. It’s just a feeling that can’t be explained.<br><br>

You are my happiness. Everything seems serene and more beautiful. Even bright sun becomes delightful. Rid of sweaty armpits, you give me an opportunity to wander even in the middle of the day. You make me a modern Mowgli wandering in gardens with my laptop, phone and (of course) books. You have made me an explorer, winter.  <br><br>
Another great thing that comes with you is, food! How can anyone not love gajar ka halwa? Or peanuts that once we start eating has no stoppage. On a healthier side, you have taught me to eat green vegetables. That fresh juice of carrots, orange, beetroot and whole lot more things that mom puts in, makes my day. Because of you, having a hot tasty soup before dinner becomes our ritual. <br><br>

Sometimes you become too cold, my runny nose and red cheeks make that evident. But I don’t mind, I wear some extra layers or sometimes it gives us an opportunity to light up bonfire. <br><br>
You also bring challenges like waking up early. I am an early bird but oh god, it becomes so difficult in winters. Shallow sunlight outside along with fog gives me one more reason to stay in my cozy quilt. But then, it also strengthens my determination and discipline. When I can give up my quilt and wake up early in winters then I can do anything.<br><br>
People say, they become lethargic because of you, always curled up in their blankets. But for me, it is one of the most active times. A stroll after dinner in my lawn, feeling the cool breeze on my face, my palms dug inside my jacket pocket and gazing at stars and moon is a pure bliss. Oh winter, I wish you could stay for whole year but then every beautiful thing comes at its own time to make that time more special and valuable. <br><br>

As always, I would wait for you to come next year. Till then, these memories given by you will always remain with me. <br><br>

Your biggest admirer <br>
Ishika
