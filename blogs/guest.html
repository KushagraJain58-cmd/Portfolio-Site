			<h1>Guest In Lockdown</h1>

			<p>In India, we always abide by the saying, “Atithi devo bhava” which means “Guest is God”. We love having guest at our home, prepare so many dishes, have quality time together. It gives us break from our daily routine and strengthens our bond with our relatives and friends who come as our guest. 
			<br><br>As everything came to halt during lockdown, so did guest. With deadly virus revolving all around the world, meeting someone outside your home became a nightmare. Forget about guest! Confined under four walls of home and not being able to meet anyone definitely took a toll on mental health. I too, sometimes felt gloomy and restless. I call it lockdown side-effects. 
			<br><br>During those days of lockdown when I was going through these side-effects, unexpectedly we had guest at our home! 
			<br>It was morning and I was sitting in my drawing room, looking out at the plants in my lawn. In morning, my dad opens all the doors and windows for ventilation. And our lawn is just outside our drawing room with numerous plants. I was lost in my own thoughts when I saw two birds going to and fro. They grabbed my attention and to my amazement, I noticed that they were making nest on one of our plants in lawn. I got up with excitement and called my dad to see this. We both excitedly watched both the birds. One was making the nest and other one was sitting higher to guard it. 
			<br><br>They both went together to gather materials for their nest and came together. After searching on internet, we found that the bird was red-whiskered bulbul, a member of bulbul family. It had brown feathers with slight touch of red ones. 
			<br><br>After so many days, this was the first time I felt excitement, same one when we have guest come over. It took them two days to make their nest and then they finally settled in their new home. 
			<br><br>After a day, I saw that bulbul had laid an egg in her nest. I felt elated to see that a new member is coming in her family. Next day, there were two red-colored eggs. I waited eagerly for her babies to come out. This was the first time I was watching a bird giving birth to her kids, that too in my home! I realized that if lockdown would not had been there, I would not have stayed at home much and missed this beautiful miracle. 
			<br><br>Bulbul stayed in her nest most of the times, protecting her eggs but one day, adding to her challenges, it was raining heavily. It was an unexpected storm which lasted for whole day. I was so worried for bulbul and her eggs. Even though, I love rain, I prayed for it to stop. I saw bulbul curled up in her nest and sleeping. I then realized her smartness. She wasn’t much affected by the rain as the place where she had built the nest was on a strong stem of Christmas tree which was under the shed of long banana leaves. So, rain droplets were not directly falling on her. Also, the nest was so strongly tied that it would take much efforts to dismantle it. I was surprised to see such thoughtfulness and intelligence of a bird. Rain and storm couldn’t harm her in any way.

			<br><br>Within few days, her kids were out of eggs. It was a beautiful scenery. Amidst the greenery of plants, stayed bulbul and her two babies in their brown-colored nest. She went out sometimes for food and fed her babies. Other bulbul had resumed its position of guarding the family. It felt like one more family was living with us. We witnessed those kids growing up. Just as we learn to walk when we are kids, same way those baby bulbuls learned to fly. They often fall down, then again tried flying with their mother always by their side. Their melodious voices filled our home with happiness and exhilaration. The gloominess and boredom of lockdown was long gone. Just as we develop a bond with our guest, these bulbuls came in my life when I most needed a new company at my home. 
			<br><br>But as every guest leave after sometime, so did these bulbuls. After baby bulbuls learned how to fly, they set off on their journey to make whole sky their home. 
			<br><br>Although, I would never meet them again but these bulbuls will always remain special to me for coming as guest at my home and making me witness one of the most beautiful phases of their life.
