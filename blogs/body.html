			<p>I have started doing meditation these days. In evening, I run in my lawn, playing rock music on my phone. I never thought that running could give me such physical high and mental peace. I have never been a sports person or someone who was very active on ground. Being a studious and chubby girl, I was most of the times away from physical activities. 
			<br><br>But these days, I am exploring new discoveries about myself, my own body. Few days back, I was doing a certain kind of meditation named ‘body scan’ and a realization struck me. 
			<br><br>We always try to change our body. If I am fat then I always tried to reduce weight. That was the only purpose for all those exercises. If someone is thin then they try to gain weight and crib if unable to do so. It’s like we are not accepting who we are and constantly trying to change it. 

			<br><br>While doing body scan, I realized that our body always takes such a good care of us. It’s every part is so important that any disturbance in any of it will lead to misfunctioning. But on the other side, we are constantly trying to change our body. We never love it or accept it. 
			Love is always two-way. My body loves me, so now it’s my turn to love it back, to take care of it. Because at last, my body is the only thing that would remain till my last breath. I accept my body the way it is.

			<br><br>Now the intension is entirely changed. Earlier, when I wanted to lose weight, the intension was that I was not accepting my body which caused certain self-disliking and insecurity. 
			<br>Now, I am doing yoga, running or any exercise just to take care of my body. Now the intension is love and caring. I am not stuck between weight numbers, trying to push myself to achieve a certain goal of less weight. The only goal is healthy body and calm mind. Just that!  
			Suddenly, things got so simple and all that disliking and insecurity vanished. Losing weight is not everything, in fact, it’s nothing. I am glad that I found my real purpose and again fallen in love with my body. </p>
