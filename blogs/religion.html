			<p>The most powerful quality that enabled humans to conquer over whole other species is imagination. Humans think in form of stories, not in equations or numbers. Stories have created societies, cultures, nations. They have brought people together but at the same time created differences. 
			<br><br>In 21st century, the most powerful stories appealing to masses are in the form of series, movies and novels. I, for instance, love the sitcom FRIENDS. I have watched it millions of times, know every dialogue by heart, in love with every character of the show. And I am not the only one. There are lakhs of people out there in whole world who feel the same way. Few days back, FRIENDS reunion show was aired after 17 years and every fan went nuts and emotional. It was like an exhilarating wave running amongst all the show lovers. Only the ones who knows the story could understand the sentiments of other one. People who don’t know the story were alienated from this wave. 
			<br><br>I remember, once I got so mad at my best friend for not watching the show after I persistently forced her for two years. I was like, “You are missing a lot in your life by not watching it. You don’t know. It’s not just a show. It’s something else. And blah blah blah!” 
			She hasn’t watched the show yet and this made me lunatic. A fiction story of six people made me fight with my best friend just because she doesn’t know the story. Aside from this show, any other show which we like, we force our friends to watch it. We want a shared community with whom we can share our love for story. And when we get one, we develop bond with those people who believe in the same story. 

			<br><br>Doesn’t it resemble like a religion?! 

			<br><br>From childhood, we are being brought up believing in a particular story that we start putting all our faith into it. We develop communities and bonds with those people who believe in the same story because they would understand our sentiments behind worshipping that particular god. But when we meet someone who doesn’t know our story or doesn’t believe in it, conflicts begin. We always believe our story to be superior than others, just like, FRIENDS is better than any other sitcom. But who knows, “The Office” or “Big Bang Theory” turn out to be better for that another person. 
			<br><br>In history, we read of forceful religion conversions, wasn’t I doing the same thing by forcing my friend to watch FRIENDS? That’s because I wanted my friend to understand my sentiments behind that story, wanted her to have same sentiments. I wanted her to believe in the same story, wanted her to be part of my community and when she didn’t, conflicts began. 

			<br><br>Everyone has their own fiction story to believe in. No story is better or worse. It depends on person’s faith that where they want to channelize their energy to gain hope and happiness. If watching FRIENDS gives me happiness then watching Big Bang Theory gives my friend her happiness. There is no reason for us to believe in the same story. We both have our own stories. The only thing is, we just need to respect and accept each other’s choice.  </p>
