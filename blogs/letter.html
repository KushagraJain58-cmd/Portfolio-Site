			<p>Dear bread earner employee in me,
			<br>Do you still miss your school or college? I hope you do because everyone does. Those were truly golden days, we realize now. In school, we always dreamt of going to college. In college, we always dreamt for a job or own startup so that we start earning and become financially independent. And now, when we are finally in that phase of independence, we just want to go back to our school and college. 
			<br><br>So, what do you most remember from your school college days? I don’t think it’s lectures but friends, those sports lectures, those extra-curricular activities where you found your so many hidden talents, those societies in college where you worked day and night to make your fest a big hit or organizing college events. So, apart from lectures everything else brings tears of joyful memories in your mind. Okay, sometimes scoring high marks or getting appreciated by your teachers is also remembered.  But did you realize one thing? There were always extra-curricular activities which always kept our lives colorful. Even classes seemed interesting when we attended them after sports period.  

			<br><br>Now when you are working, where have all those activities, interests, passions gone? You were not this boring before. You always took out time for your hobbies from all your studying and assignments. Now, have you lost all your interests or like everyone else, you also hide behind that line, “I don’t get time”. No one has time for anything, you need to take out time. You have grown up with these extra-curricular activities so how can you just abandon them. See, that’s the reason you have made your life so black & white that you always whine about your job. Work is the main stream of your life and that’s important. But your interests, passions, hobbies and time for them is also important so that you don’t sunk into pool of boredom. 

			<br><br>Find out what makes you happy and satisfied. You had sports period in school, so take out a sports period from your life and workout. You had singing lessons in school. Don’t worry if you have a bad voice, instead dance then. Explore your passion, your interest whether it’s writing, painting, singing or maybe creating a meme page on Instagram. Like you chose extra-curricular activities in school as per your interest, now choose extra-curricular activities of your life and paint it with different strokes of colors.

			<br><br>From
			<br>Dreamer still alive inside you
