			<p>It was 5th April, 2021 when finally, I brought her to my home. She looked beautiful. It's been 12 years since I longed to bring her home. Determined this time, I bought a cycle. 
				<br>My childhood would have been incomplete without riding a cycle. All the games, we used to play, 'traffic-traffic', 'chor-police' and the fake paper licence we made to act like a grown up are some golden memories imprinted in my heart forever. I had a yellow-colored cycle with a basket at front and colourful wheels. That time, black tyred cycles were for grown-ups only. I was confined to riding in my society and not go out because of potential dangers. 
				<br>When I was in 5th class, I started demanding my parents for a new cycle with "black tyres". They stalled me for a while by saying, "We will buy you a new cycle on your birthday in November. The money you get on festivals from relatives, save it in your gullak and then we will buy."
				<br>I was thrilled to save money for my new cycle. I started my collection in April and time to time counted those 100, 500 rupees notes in my gullak, reaching close to my target of Rs.3,000/-. By the time of my 11th birthday, I had collected the required amount to buy a cycle and again demanded from my parents. But unfortunately, they couldn't understand my passion and coaxed me that cycle is of no use now. They will buy me a scooty in next two three years. It's much better. I was heartbroken and felt that collection in my gullak to be waste. I couldn't argue and thus, parted my ways with cycle. Although, eventually I started riding scooty at the age of 15. It had its own fun but still, nothing can replace cycle. 
				<br>Now, at the age of 23, my old love for cycle reignited. It came to me in the form of rented cycles in Central Delhi called 'Smartbikes'. Riding the cycle in cool breeze of winters with a friend made me fall in love with cycles again. Watching sunset behind India Gate with greenery all around, riding on magical roads of Central Delhi in Connaught Place, Mandi House, Lodhi road, Golf road, Panchkuian road and many more was a pure sense of freedom. Freedom from the confinement of my society, freedom of being grown-up and making my own decisions, freedom from all the negative emotions. 
				<br>That yearning of having a cycle came back as an unfulfilled wish. It felt like a story is left incomplete. 
				<br>So, again after 12 years, I demanded cycle from my parents. My father laughed at me for few days but when he saw that I was serious, real arguments took its place. When I can drive a car, the idea of buying a cycle especially at this age seemed absurd to him. But this time, no coaxing could change my mind. I convinced my parents, made them realise my passion which I couldn't do before. This time, instead of gullak collection, I thought of my salary to be my medium of fulfilling my wish. But my father admonished me and paid for my cycle as my long due birthday gift. 
       			<br>A story which began in April 2009 and was left incomplete for 12 years, at last got complete on 5th April, 2021.
