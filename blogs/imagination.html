			<p>Human is a rare species, we all have heard of it and living it. What makes us different from other animals? It’s the power of thinking, the power of imagination. Within milli seconds, human brain cells can run 1000 miles building castles in the air. It’s the imagination that has made humans superior of all, conquer the whole world and live like a king. But not all humans live like a king. If imagination has given power, it has also shackled humans into pieces. Why do we always hear or read such quotes, “seize the day”, “live in the moment” because humans have made this tendency to live in their imagination, in past or future. They develop fantasies which either take them to seventh cloud or smash them on ground with uncountable bruises. And it’s all happening inside the brain. 
			<br><br>The one where we imagine that there is only doom ahead is termed as negative fantasy. Let me give you an example. Few days earlier, I was suffering from a severe throat infection. My voice was hoarse and I couldn’t even eat or drink. There was constant pain in my throat as if someone had tied a rope around it very tightly. I took medicine but it had no effect. Later that night before sleeping, I had this negative fantasy that soon I will lose my voice. I wouldn’t be able to speak again or my voice would be hoarse forever. It freaked the hell out of me. I started crying at just the idea of losing my voice. Well, why was that freaking tormenting was because I want to RJ, Radio Jockey. I have a sweet soft voice, a very unique one (well, that’s what people say) and that’s the one thing which is dearest to my heart. 
			<br><br>Now, imagine a person who wants to make a career out of her voice or rather it’s her dream to be a performer and public speaker, has this negative fantasy of losing her voice, how she would react to it. I felt like drowning deep into ocean where no one can hear me. That pain in my throat became suffocating. I wanted my original voice back at that very moment. This one thought of losing voice led to more negative fantasies like I am messaging my close friends that I wouldn’t be able to talk to them on call ever again. I am learning sign language on internet. My parents are distressed. My brain didn’t even take a minute to have all these fantasies. I was panicking, sweating and in tears. That’s the power of imagination. 
			<br><br>Some time or other, we all do the same thing. For instance, if a person loses job, he might imagine that few months later, he is on road with no money, no rent to pay or food to eat. When in relationship, people stop imagining their lives without their special partner and an idea of break-up send shock waves in their body. They think how will they live, how will they move on but when facing the reality, they do move on. An unemployed person does find another source of income. It’s just our brain that anticipate the worst case although reality is poles apart. And it targets right at the soft spot, the thing which is dearest to us. 
			<br><br>The negative fantasies make us inactive to solve problems. We just keep on drowning in that pit and confuse fantasy with reality. This is where mental health problem begins. Negative fantasy is the origin of mental health deterioration. 
			<br>The next stage is self-fulfilling prophecy. It occurs when our own expectations influence our behavior or when it influences other people’s actions. In layman’s language, it means that beliefs can actually create reality. What we expect from ourselves or from others, they actually start behaving that way. Thus, when a person persistently lives with his negative fantasies, there is a higher probability for them becoming true. It leads to confirmation bias. It means that we stick to the information that is consistent with our perception rather than going out of our way to clarify it and contradict it. It makes us lethargic to step up against those negative fantasies and remedy our mental condition.
			<br><br>Now, where does solution lie? If we curb the origin of this problem, i.e., negative fantasy then there is no moving forward. So, how did I fight against my negative fantasies that night when I was petrified of losing my voice? Well, I came back into reality. It’s not that easy as it sounds. Amid all those negative emotions which are pulling you hard into that pool of negative fantasy, all you need to do is cut that string and see what reality looks like. I realized that I didn’t meet with a major accident that could cause loss of voice. Rather it was natural like we have regular cough only a bit worse than that. Also, medical science has progressed to such an extent that there are all treatments available if anything severe happens. And then also, if my negative fantasy does come true then we will see then, why think of it now and traumatize myself. There is whole list of solutions like talk to your family and friends about your problem and many more. But the primary one is come back into reality. Reality is not that disastrous and unmanageable as anticipated in fantasies. We have made this our habit to exaggerate things, so does our brain. It exaggerates our problems and show us the dead end through the power of imagination. 
			<br>But the power of reality is no less. It’s just, we need to stay in it.
