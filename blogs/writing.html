			<p>A friend of mine asked me one day, "What is your inspiration behind writing? From where do you get that patience to sit and write?"
			At first, I was speechless. I didn't know what to say or how to describe my inspiration. I guess, the answer to this question is easier to write than to tell. So, here is the answer.

			<br><br>A few years ago, I started writing out of a spark, a sudden inspiration which motivated me to pen down a couple of shayaris like most of the people. No, it was not a heartbreak or a breakup. Please, let's stop this Orthodox opinion that only "Devdas" people can write shayaris. Happy people also write. And I believe, I am a living example of it.
			<br><br>So, after writing a few shayaris, I started discovering this world more. Started reading poetry legends. Expanded it further to stories, novels, scripts and anything I can find in literature.
			<br><br>Slowly, the secrets of this world started unravelling before me. With every poem and story, I grew more attached to this world, similar to falling in love, I guess.

			<br><br>With every poem I wrote, with every story, I felt empowered. The satisfaction I got after penning down my thoughts into beautiful words of poetry or after finishing a story, I don't think I can describe it in words. Even though, I am a writer but still, there are few things which I can't write.
			<br><br>The time when I am engrossed in writing, it feels like I am not in this world. Even if I am standing on the busy street with people passing by, I can't see or hear anyone. I am just in that rhythm of poetry or story. Writing gives me freedom to escape this world and then come back to it at my own will. Itâ€™s like meditation.

			<br><br>Writing has given me the most beautiful gift of life which is empathy where I can feel people, where I can step out of my shoe and feel who they really are. Humans are meant to be connected to each other and writing is what makes me connected to others. It gives me power to understand other's love, pain, aspirations, thoughts, emotions which they have experienced but I can feel it too. It makes me live a life beyond myself and see the world through different lenses.

			<br><br>So I guess, answer to my friend's question is writing.
			<br><br>The inspiration behind my writing IS writing. The more I write, the more I am inspired, the more I feel other's emotions, the more I connect with my fellow loving humans. Writing makes me feel alive. And I was born to live.
