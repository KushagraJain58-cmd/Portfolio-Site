						</div>
						<div class="para">
							<p>September 26, 2021<br><br>A friend of mine asked me one day, "What is your inspiration behind writing? From where do you get that patience to sit and write?"<br>At first, I was speechless. I didn't know what to say or how to describe my inspiration. I guess, the answer to this question is easier to write than to tell. So, here is the answer.<br>A few years ago, I started writing out of a spark, a sudden inspiration which motivated me to pen down a couple of shayaris like most of the people. No, it was not a heartbreak or a breakup. Please, let's stop this Orthodox opinion that only "Devdas" people can write shayaris. Happy people also write. And I believe, I am a living example of it.

							You come and go every year. For me, you are like a festival. A festival which brings peace and comfort. A festival which is most awaited throughout the year. People ask me, “Why do you love winter so much?”
							I answer, “Because I love to wear boots, mufflers, hoodies, jackets, overall, all winter clothes.” Well, that’s only half truth. Even I don’t know one exact reason why I love you so much. It’s just a feeling that can’t be explained.

Determined this time, I bought a cycle.<br> My childhood would have been incomplete without riding a cycle. All the games, we used to play, 'traffic-traffic', 'chor-police' and the fake paper licence we made to act like a grown up are some golden memories imprinted in my heart forever.I had a yellow-colored cycle with a basket at front and colourful wheels. That time, black tyred cycles were for grown-ups only. I was confined to riding in my society and not go out because of potential dangers.  </p>

						<div class="para">
							<p>July 09, 2021 <br><br>In India, we always abide by the saying, “Atithi devo bhava” which means “Guest is God”. We love having guest at our home, prepare so many dishes, have quality time together. It gives us break from our daily routine and strengthens our bond with our relatives and friends who come as our guest. <br>As everything came to halt during lockdown, so did guest. With deadly virus revolving all around the world, meeting someone outside your home became a nightmare. Forget about guest! Confined under four walls of home and not being able to meet anyone definitely took a toll on mental health. I too, sometimes felt gloomy and restless. I call it lockdown side-effects.

I never thought that running could give me such physical high and mental peace. I have never been a sports person or someone who was very active on ground. Being a studious and chubby girl, I was most of the times away from physical activities. <br>But these days, I am exploring new discoveries about myself, my own body. Few days back, I was doing a certain kind of meditation named ‘body scan’ and a realization struck me. </p>

			<br>Do you still miss your school or college? I hope you do because everyone does. Those were truly golden days, we realize now. In school, we always dreamt of going to college. In college, we always dreamt for a job or own startup so that we start earning and become financially independent. And now, when we are finally in that phase of independence, we just want to go back to our school and college.

							<p>May 30, 2021 <br><br>The most powerful quality that enabled humans to conquer over whole other species is imagination. Humans think in form of stories, not in equations or numbers. Stories have created societies, cultures, nations. They have brought people together but at the same time created differences. <br>In 21st century, the most powerful stories appealing to masses are in the form of series, movies and novels. I, for instance, love the sitcom FRIENDS. I have watched it millions of times, know every dialogue by heart, in love with every character of the show. </p>

							<p>June 15, 2020<br><br>Human is a rare species, we all have heard of it and living it. What makes us different from other animals? It’s the power of thinking, the power of imagination. Within milli seconds, human brain cells can run 1000 miles building castles in the air. It’s the imagination that has made humans superior of all, conquer the whole world and live like a king. But not all humans live like a king. If imagination has given power, it has also shackled humans into pieces. Why do we always hear or read such quotes, “seize the day”, “live in the moment” because humans have made this tendency to live in their imagination, in past or future. They develop fantasies which either take them to seventh cloud or smash them on ground with uncountable bruises. And it’s all happening inside the brain  </p>

Just like a woman dress for a party with jewellery, you are up there wearing millions of silver jewellery and a heavy golden one embarking your beauty. You know, here on earth, people have this belief that when they see a shooting star, they make a wish and believe that it will come true. Ah, bollywood filmy beliefs you know! So, when I saw a shooting star for the first time, I didn't get time to make a wish, it was so fast and so sudden.</p>

For whole life, we stock our brain from all sorts of tension for career, job, country's economy, money, market because of which we somehow forget to live. As people say, "seize the day" but they never do. When it comes to human life, everything else just fades away.<br>Market all over the worldwide is crashing, share market has never seen such a low hit, GDP of the country is at its minimum, there is recession all over, events are being cancelled incurring losses of millions. Everything is shutting down, schools, colleges, markets, gyms, malls, theatres, offices. I don't know if it has ever happened, everyone around the globe is staying at their home. All because to save life.</p>
