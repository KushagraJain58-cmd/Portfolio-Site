			<p>Dear Sky,
			<br>I see you daily and I wonder why can't I touch you, why can't I roam around you?
			<br>The clouds become my canvas where I paint my dreams and let them shape on their own.
			<br>At night, sky you look gorgeous. Just like a woman dress for a party with jewellery, you are up there wearing millions of silver jewellery and a heavy golden one embarking your beauty. You know, here on earth, people have this belief that when they see a shooting star, they make a wish and believe that it will come true. Ah, bollywood filmy beliefs you know! So, when I saw a shooting star for the first time, I didn't get time to make a wish, it was so fast and so sudden. But you know, the main reason I didn't make a wish was because I was totally engrossed in that magic of yours that how a star who is millions of light years far suddenly feels like it's coming to us. It felt like you sent that star to me. I know that's not exactly a star but a meteor, a small piece of rock in space (okay, I totally googled it) but believing that it's a star makes this concept more interesting, so I will stick to that.

			<br><br>Sky, you have become symbol of freedom for people here on earth. Whenever they are fed up with their lives or are feeling "trapped", they say, "Oh, I want to fly in sky, have wings like a bird and fly high above from all this chaos." I don't know why they are so obsessed by birds! Can't they just be satisfied with their human life? They are the ones who are creating chaos on this earth, so why do they think that they will not do same with you? They think that flying away is freedom, uff...being human myself, I sometimes don't understand my fellow companions.
			<br><br>I mean I know flying is an experience which we cannot forget, maybe the most exciting and satisfying moment. Even I have sky-diving in my bucket list but how does it set you free! Yes, it sets you free at that moment but human will be human who will never stop making chaos whether on earth or in sky.

			<br><br>Sky, I thank you as you have given me some unforgettable moments which I cherish my whole life like that sunrise from desert sam dunes, that sunset into sea as if sun is diving into water from you. You always show such beautiful colours, specially at dawn and dusk. Whenever someone asks colour of yours, people have just one answer, 'blue' but that's not true. You show us every colour that we want to see, sometimes pink, sometimes orange, yellow, purple and sometimes even seven colours at one time, yes rainbow! For me, the most beautiful gift of yours is rain. I can never overcome from my love for rain. Whenever you bless us with those droplets, it feels like we have come closer at that moment.

			<br><br>So sky, thank you for always being there at top of us protecting us from all the rocks and dangerous substances revolving around in space. Just one request, please don't let sun be too shiny, it's been creating havoc here on earth and when you wear your silver jewellery at night, show it to us, don't hide back behind clouds and in urban areas, smog and pollution, I love to see your enticing look. Sky, you give peace to me which I can't explain in words. Looking at you helps me escape from this world and my train of overcrowded thoughts. So, all I can say is thank you for being so calming. I will end this letter with a shayari which I wrote for you,

			<br><br>"ऐ फ़लक, तुझे चाहते बहुत है हम
			<br>जानते है, ये फासला कभी ख़त्म न‌ होगा
			<br>मगर फिर भी रोज़ दीदार तेरा करते है हम"

			<br><br>Your admirer here on earth,
			<br>Ishika
