						<h2>My Writing Journey<hr></h2>
					</div>
					<div class="my-story-para">
						<p>“Writing is like breathing to me. We don’t take out time for breathing, so does for writing”. Hey there! If there is one word that describes me well is, "Explorer". I am an explorer set out in this chaotic world with my crazy thoughts ready to accept any challenge that comes my way.
						<br> I am always open to new experiences and in search of new stories to pen down. So, maybe you got the idea that I am a writer. I love to write poems, stories, blogs and scripts. I started my writing journey during my under-graduation. It started with a spark, a sudden inspiration which motivated me to pen down a couple of shayaris like most of the people. But then, I started discovering this world more. Started reading poetry legends. Expanded it further to stories, novels, scripts and anything I could find in literature. Slowly, the secrets of this world started unraveling before me. With every poem and story, I grew more attached to this world, similar to falling in love, I guess.</p>

						<h2>Educational Background<hr></h2>
					</div>
					<div class="edu-back-para">
						<p> I have been born and brought up in <b>Delhi</b>, did my schooling and graduation from here itself. In 12th class, my good percentage landed up me in <i><u><b>North Campus, Delhi University</b></u></i> pursuing<b><u> Economics Hons.</u></b> a dream of every commerce student. But soon enough, I realised that I am not made for this field. Continuously failing in all the MA (Economics) entrance exams, I did not get admission in any college. With shackled confidence and nowhere to go to, I started applying for jobs.  But destiny had something else stored for me.<br><br> Rather than dealing with numbers and data anymore, I chose to go into creative field. That’s when, I took admission in<u><b><i> MA (PR & Event Management) in Amity University</i></b></u> in 2018. I unleashed my potential there and enhanced my skills in communication, management, radio and much more. </p>
